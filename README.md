Credit Card Fraud Detection
This is our final year B.tech project .

The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

We have used a total of 5 algorithms in our project

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbours
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XgBoost
6 Techniques are used for undersampling or oversampling

Random oversampling
SMOTE Oversampling
Random Undersampling
Tomek Links Undersampling
Cluster centroids undersampling
SMOTE + Tomek Links
We have compared each of the 5 algorithms in all 7 scenarios comparing their accuracy through Area under curve of ROC Curve.
